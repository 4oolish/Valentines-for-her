Foolish I shall be, if it means having you here with me. 
You can't reason with love, so I wish for you to see the most asinine thoughts appearing in my head. 

Your love makes me feel complete. After all, a soulmate isn't your missing piece, but a compliment. 
Your presence to me is like a moth to a flame, always drawing me in the most unexpected ways. 
The way my finger drifts to your profile unbeknownst to me, the way my gaze slowly moves to your general direction, and the way you suddenly wander in my mind like an annoying voice. 

I've tried to move on, but I couldn't — di ko kaya eh. 
Perhaps loving you is the most natural and easiest thing I could do because maybe it's in my nature. 
I'm a slave to your love, a humble believer of your grace, and you act as my knowledge that guides me as a scholar. 

To not see beauty in you means to have lost my sight, 
to not love you means to have lost my heart, 
to not think of you means to have lost my mind. 
It feels blasphemous just stopping to think of you. 
It's blasphemous for it goes against my nature and my very being. 

A love that will slowly devour me, and yet I face it with such pride for it's love that's yours. 
WBAHAHHA, seryusuhon, noh? In all seriousness.. SERIOUSNESS??? joke 😁, pero seryoso, feel ko aram mo mn sana na ika ang crush ko eh. 

Yis po, opo, mahal pa rin kita, at walang iba. 
Saimo mn sana ako mabalik eh, sa hug mo maski dae taka pa nahahug. 
Diyan pa lng eh, ano laban ki iba? 

Yes po, gabos na tinaram ko about sa secret crush ko, ika ito. 
Naka move on na kuta ako saimo, napanagi
